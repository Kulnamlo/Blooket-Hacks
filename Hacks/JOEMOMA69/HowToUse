# How to use.
Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) then do `pip install requests` and `pip install colorama` in cmd/terminal to install required packages.
Next, edit config.json with your login info and the desired amount of tokens.

# How it works.
It works due to blooket's api not implementing a ratelimit system, this means that you can spam it with requests and doing so will allow you to open boxes until you have negative tokens or sell way more characters than you have therefore 'duping' your coins.

# Information

As far as I know, this is the first way to 'hack' coins without a limit of 500/day.

Tested on Windows Server 2019 & Arch Linux.
